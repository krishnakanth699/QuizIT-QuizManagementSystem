# QuizIT - QuizManagementSystem
The "Quiz Management System" project will be created to solve the
manual system's time-consuming issue. In addition, the existing
approach wastes time by having examiners check answer papers
following tests; however, our application will verify the proper
response, saving time and ensuring a successful examination. Users of
this system don't need to have advanced computing skills, and the
system will alert users when they enter erroneous data.

The goal of this project is to handle information about the students,
exams, grades, and classrooms. The assignment of the quiz will be
completely within the authority of the teacher, who can ensure that
anyone can access it.

# Project Scope
Quiz Management System aims at the automation of following processes:

1. System will allow to log in teachers and students through their unique id and password.
2. System will allow teachers to create classroom for their students.
3. System will allow student to join the classroom with unique id.
4. System will allow teachers to create and edit the quiz.
5. System will allow students in the class to view their upcoming quiz, to attend the quiz and to view the marks of the attended quiz.
6. System will allow teachers and students to edit their profile.
